If modifying on anything but a linux, you must open this with winrar, pull the lambda_function.py, then modify that file, and finally add it through the winrar add interface. If done any other way then it will cause permission issues as linux permissions will be lost. Please upload this file to an S3 Bucket and link it to Lambda. The file is too big for a straight upload to Lambda.
